# Modern Control Theory | Modern Control For Robotics
### CMU 24677 - Project Demos

In this class, we were tasked with developing our own controllers to enable a car to complete a trajectory in a [Webot](https://cyberbotics.com/) simulation environment. I develoepd 5 different controls (PID, LQR, ...) for the Tesla to complete the path as fast as possible while meeting the acchracy requirements. Through the projects, I was able to deepen my understanding of different control systems and their applications in autonomous vehicles.
